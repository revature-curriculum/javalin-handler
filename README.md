## Javalin Handler Challenge
---
### Description
In this lab, we will cover how to use handlers within your Javalin web application.

---
### Steps
1. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java, create a String ArrayList that will contain your favorite characters(from books, movies, games, etc.).
2. On the same class, following the movie example, complete the implementation for the characterHandler. Add at least 4 characters to your list. Use a for loop to iterate over the list and have the web page display as a list of Strings.
3. Add a '/favcharacters' route that can be used along with the characterHandler.
